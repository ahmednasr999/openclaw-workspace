## MONDAY: Industry Insight

**MONDAY: Industry Insight 🌍**

Healthcare in the GCC is undergoing its biggest transformation in decades.

With 20+ years leading digital initiatives at Intel, Microsoft, Network International, and Delivery Hero, I've seen firsthand what works—and what doesn't—when modernizing legacy systems.

Here's what I'm seeing in 2026:

🔹 The winners are NOT those with the most advanced technology
🔹 They're the ones who bridge clinical workflows with data-driven insights
🔹 Patient-centricity isn't a buzzword—it's the new operating model

We're now deploying AI-powered Clinical Decision Support systems across hospitals in KSA, UAE & Egypt—reducing clinical variation and improving patient safety.

The challenge? Technology is the easy part. Change management is the hard part.

What are YOU seeing in your industry?

## WEDNESDAY: Case Study

**WEDNESDAY: Case Study 📋**

How do you launch a SuperApp for 100M users in one year?

When I led the Yalla SuperApp launch at PaySky, the stakes were clear:
→ Egypt's first true SuperApp
→ Financial inclusion → digital empowerment
→ Redefining financial services for the region

The playbook:

1️⃣ Start with user journeys, not features
2️⃣ Partner with banks, not compete
3️⃣ Build for offline-first (60% of users)
4️⃣ Test relentlessly, launch once

Result: Disrupted an entire market.

The same principles apply to Healthcare Digital Transformation today.

## FRIDAY: Leadership Lesson

**FRIDAY: Leadership Lesson 🎯**

I learned this at Intel, Microsoft, and Network International—and it changed everything:

**"Turn bold vision into execution that delivers measurable reality."**

Managing 300+ concurrent projects across 7 countries taught me:

✅ Clarity > Ambition
✅ Milestones > Deadlines  
✅ Team > Technology
✅ Execution > Strategy (yes, really)

When I built the PMO from scratch at Network International, we didn't start with tools.

We started with: "What does success look like, and how do we measure it every single week?"

20+ years later, I still lead with that question.

What's YOUR leadership philosophy?
