Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] [recent news if found]. Impressive work on [specific area].

I'm helping hospital groups across the GCC transform their operations with AI automation. We recently helped a 15-hospital network reduce PMO reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes.

Happy to share our playbook. 15 min?

Best,
Ahmed
Founder, ANCO Consulting

**Template for HealthTech Founders:**

Hi [Name],

Congratulations on [Company]'s [recent milestone].

I scaled a consumer platform from 30K to 7M daily operations using AI automation. Now I help HealthTech companies do the same.

15 min to share lessons learned?

Best,
Ahmed

   - "What have you tried before?"
   - "What's the cost of not solving this?"

### Discovery Call Script (30 min)

```

```

**Next Steps (3 min):**

Would it make sense to do a deeper assessment? I can look at your current state and outline what a 90-day transformation would look like. 30 min, no obligation. Does that work?

## KEY MESSAGES

**Value Proposition (15 seconds):**
```
We help hospitals and HealthTech companies transform operations with AI-driven PMO, delivering measurable ROI within 90 days.
```

**Elevator Pitch (60 seconds):**
```
I help healthcare organizations implement AI automation that reduces reporting time by 97%, detects risks 3 weeks earlier, and saves $400K+ annually. We've done this for hospital groups like Saudi German and HealthTech companies that scaled 233x. The key is embedding AI into the PMO - making project management strategic instead of administrative.
```

**Tagline:**
```
Strategy That Scales. Execution That Delivers.
```
