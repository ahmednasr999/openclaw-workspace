Digital Transformation & HealthTech/FinTe.\n2yr-\u00ae\n\n#FinTech | & Uber Payments Processing Architecture S\n\n#Uber processes billions of dollars in payments every year. To ensure that these payments are processed\nsecurely and consistently, Uber uses a complex architecture that is based on the principles of double-entry\nbookkeeping.\n\n& The architecture consists of two main parts: collections and disbursements. Collections handle the process\nof collecting payments from riders and eaters, while disbursements handle the process of paying out money to\ndrivers and restaurants.\n\n& @@Q J Uber's payment processing architecture solves the challenge of creating consistent data to move\nmoney securely at scale. With users in 70 countries, a multi-region setup, and a complex payment structure,\nACID transactions and the Saga pattern don't work. Instead, Uber uses retry jobs that constantly scan\ntransactions and fix failed parts to achieve data consistency.\n\n& The payment flow starts with the creation of an order for a ridesharing trip or a payout to a driver. The order\nprocessing service selects the right processor based on geographical location and payment method, and the\norder Reader/Writer service persists data in the database and updates accounts and balances. The data access\nservice generates invoices, receipts, statements, and taxes based on the orders stored in the DB.\n \\dempotency is also important in the system to handle duplicate requests and prevent data discrepancies\nand double-spending problems. Uber uses unique IDs and logic to validate requests to ensure accounts are\ncorrectly debited and credited.\n\nA && Uber's engineers have created a reliable and secure payment processing architecture that ensures\nconsistent data and seamless transactions for users worldwide.\n",
