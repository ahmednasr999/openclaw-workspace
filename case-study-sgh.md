# CASE STUDY 1: Saudi German Hospital Group Digital Transformation

## The Challenge

Saudi German Hospital Group (SGH), a 15-hospital network across KSA, UAE, and Egypt, was struggling with:
- Manual PMO processes taking 40+ hours/week
- Delayed risk detection (issues discovered 2-3 weeks late)
- No standardized reporting across 3 countries
- Limited visibility into project portfolio health

## The Solution

We implemented an AI-Driven PMO framework that transformed operations:

### Phase 1: Assessment (Weeks 1-2)
- Audit of existing PMO processes
- AI readiness assessment
- Stakeholder interviews (50+ leaders)
- Custom roadmap development

### Phase 2: Implementation (Weeks 3-8)
- AI automation for status reporting
- Predictive risk detection models
- Centralized dashboard (Power BI + Custom)
- Standardized templates and workflows

### Phase 3: Optimization (Weeks 9-12)
- Machine learning for resource allocation
- Automated escalation workflows
- Executive reporting automation
- Continuous improvement cycle
