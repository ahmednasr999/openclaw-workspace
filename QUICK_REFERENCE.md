## 🎓 CV OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)

**Before ANY CV work, read:** `/root/.openclaw/workspace/CV_OPTIMIZATION_PROTOCOL.md`

**Key Lesson (68→88/100 score improvement):**
> ATS optimization requires obsessive keyword matching, not just professional formatting.

**CV Process:**
1. Extract ALL keywords from job description
2. Score current CV (target: 85%+ match)
3. Rewrite EVERY bullet with 2-3 keywords
4. Frame through job's key themes
5. Verify 85%+ before submitting

**Failure Case:** Director of DT CV - missed 14/20 keywords, scored 55% vs Claude's 95%
