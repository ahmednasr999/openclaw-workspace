## QUICK REFERENCE CARDS

### Discovery Call Script (Keep at Desk)

**OPENING (2 min)**
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. Before we dive in, what's the biggest digital or operational challenge keeping you up at night right now?"

**LISTEN (10 min)** - Take notes on:
- Current situation
- Pain points
- What they've tried
- Budget/timeline
- Decision-making process

**POSITIONING (5 min)**
"What I'm hearing is [summarize]. We've helped similar organizations like [SGH/Talatab/Network] solve this. Specifically, we achieved [result] for them."

**NEXT STEPS (3 min)**
"Would it make sense to do a deeper assessment? I can look at your current state and outline what a 90-day transformation would look like. 30 min, no obligation. Does that work?"

**CLOSE**
"Great. I'll send a calendar link. What works better - Tuesday or Thursday, morning or afternoon?"

### 15-Second Elevator Pitch

"We help hospitals and HealthTech companies transform operations with AI-driven PMO. We've helped organizations like Saudi German Hospital achieve 97% reduction in reporting time and $400K+ annual savings. The key is embedding AI into project management - making it strategic instead of administrative."

---

### 60-Second Pitch

"I help healthcare organizations implement AI automation that reduces reporting time by 97%, detects risks 3 weeks earlier, and saves $400K+ annually. 

I've done this for hospital groups like Saudi German Hospital across 15 facilities, and for HealthTech companies that scaled 233x in 18 months.

The approach is simple: I embed with your team for 90 days, implement the automation, train your people, and deliver measurable ROI. Not theory - execution.

I'm currently working with SGH on their digital transformation, so I understand healthcare operations from the inside."

### Value Proposition Matrix

| Prospect Pain | Our Solution | Their Outcome |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| Manual reporting (4+ hrs/week) | AI automated reporting | 97% time reduction |
| Late risk detection (3 weeks) | Predictive AI models | 3-day detection |
| No standardized processes | Governance framework | 91% on-time delivery |
| Budget overruns (22%) | ML resource allocation | 5% variance |
| Limited visibility | Real-time dashboards | 100% transparency |

---

### Common Objections & Responses

**"We're too small for AI"**
"Size isn't the issue - readiness is. Even a 50-bed hospital can save 20+ hours/month on reporting alone. We start small and scale."

**"We have an internal IT team"**
"Great - we work with them, not against them. Our role is strategy and implementation; your team handles ongoing ops. Think of us as fractional CDO."

**"We've tried automation before"**
"What went wrong? Most failed attempts are due to workflow issues, not technology. We fix the process first, then automate."

**"It's too expensive"**
"What's the cost of not solving this? A $50K investment typically returns $400K+ annually. ROI in 2-4 months."

**"We need to think about it"**
"Absolutely. What's the main thing you want to think through? I can provide additional information to help."

### Discovery Questions (Ask During Call)

**Situation**
- "Tell me about your current operations."
- "How is the PMO structured today?"
- "What tools and systems are you using?"

**Problem**
- "What's the biggest pain point right now?"
- "Where is the most time being wasted?"
- "What keeps you up at night?"

**Impact**
- "How much does this problem cost you annually?"
- "How many people are affected?"
- "What's the risk of not solving this?"

**History**
- "What have you tried before?"
- "What worked? What didn't?"
- "Why did those fail?"

**Decision**
- "Who else would need to be involved in this decision?"
- "What's your timeline for solving this?"
- "What would need to be true for this to be successful?"
