# 2026-02-16 — Session Notes

**Quick Reference:** See `memory/INDEX.md` for stable facts, current objectives, and key decisions.

## Model Switching Protocol (Agreed with Ahmed)

**Manual switches:**
- Before: Ask for approval ("Recommend switching to [model]. Approve?")
- Wait for Ahmed's yes/no
- After: Confirm ("Switched to [model]. Ready.")

**Auto-fallback (model failure):**
- Switch happens immediately (can't wait)
- Notify after: "⚠️ [Model] failed: [reason]. Auto-switched to [fallback]. Suggestion: [fix]"

**After complex tasks:**
- Ask if Ahmed wants to switch back to default (MiniMax)

## Config Changes Today

- Fixed crash caused by invalid `"bind": "127.0.0.1"` in gateway config (should use "loopback" or omit)
- Set up model fallback chain: Claude → MiniMax
- Currently on Claude Opus 4.5 (switched at Ahmed's request)
- Default remains MiniMax-M2.1

## Model Tier Strategy (Agreed)

| Task Type | Model | Cost |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Default / daily chat | MiniMax-M2.1 | Free |
| Heartbeats / cron / background | MiniMax-M2.1 | Free |
| Gmail checking / routine tasks | MiniMax-M2.1 | Free |
| CV creation | Claude Sonnet 4 | $3/$15 |
| **CV review / quality check** | **Claude Opus 4.5** | $15/$75 |
| Complex analysis | Claude Opus 4.5 | $15/$75 |

## CV Review Workflow (Agreed)

1. Ahmed sends CV for review
2. Recommend: "CV review? Recommend Opus for quality check. Approve?"
3. Ahmed: Yes/No
4. Switch to Opus → review → ask to switch back to default

## Key Lesson
- Don't manually edit config files — use CLI/UI which validates against schema
