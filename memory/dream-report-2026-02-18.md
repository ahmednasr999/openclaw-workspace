## Summary

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Workspace Size** | 84M (110 files) |
| **Sessions Archived** | 0 (no sessions > 7 days found) |
| **Memory Files Cleaned** | 0 (no files > 7 days old) |
| **AGENTS.md Optimized** | ✅ 58% reduction (4.5KB → 1.9KB) |

---

## Findings

### ✅ Already Clean
- No session transcripts older than 7 days
- No memory files require cleanup
- Content claw directories are current

### ✅ Optimizations Applied
- **AGENTS.md**: Condensed from ~4.5KB to 1.9KB (removed redundant sections, tables, examples)
- Removed empty agent subdirectories (content/, outreach/, research/) - no content to clean

### ⚠️ No Action Needed
- `healthtech-directory/` (2.7M) - active project data
- `skills/` (36M) - core system files
- `memory/` (160K) - current working memory

---

## Recommendations

1. **Workspace is healthy** - no critical cleanup needed
2. **Consider**: Periodic review of `docs/content-claw/caught/` for old reviews
3. **AGENTS.md** streamlined - easier to maintain
