Hospitals spend $15M+ on EMR implementations.

Most never see the ROI.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about healthcare IT investments:

The software isn't the problem. The implementation is.

I've watched hospital after hospital make the same mistakes:

❌ Treating EMR as an IT project instead of a clinical transformation
❌ Ignoring workflow redesign (just "install and train")
❌ Measuring success by "system goes live" not by outcomes
❌ Forgetting that physicians will find workarounds if the system doesn't work FOR them

The hospitals that DO see ROI?

They treat the EMR as a catalyst for:
• Removing $2M in redundant tests annually
• Cutting discharge times by 40 minutes per patient
• Reducing medication errors by 60%
• Freeing up 20% of nursing time for patient care

The technology is成熟 (mature). The ROI exists.

The question is: Are you implementing software, or transforming care?

If your EMR investment isn't delivering measurable clinical and financial outcomes, the problem isn't the vendor.

It's the approach.

What EMR ROI challenges are you seeing in your organization?
