Steve Jobs would regularly ask Jony Ive:

"How many things have you said 'no' to?"

Focus isn't saying no to bad ideas.

It's saying no to phenomenal ideas that aren't THE idea.

In digital transformation, I see this constantly:

• 15 "strategic priorities" (none actually prioritized)
• Every shiny tool gets a pilot
• The PMO tracks 200 projects but delivers none

The best executives I've worked with have one question:

"Why are we talking about this?"

If it's not the main thing, it's a distraction dressed as opportunity.

As Jony Ive put it:

"Focus means saying 'no' to something you believe with every bone in your body is a phenomenal idea."

What phenomenal idea are you saying no to right now?
