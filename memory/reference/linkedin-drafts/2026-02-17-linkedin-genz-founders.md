69% increase in people calling themselves "founder" on LinkedIn.

The median Y Combinator founder is now 24, down from 30.

Three forces are reshaping talent:

1. AI gives inexperienced workers foundational competence overnight
2. Traditional jobs are harder to get
3. The founder lifestyle is glorified

50% of Gen Z plans to start a business in 2026.

As a digital transformation leader, I'm watching this closely.

The best talent isn't waiting for your org chart anymore.

They're not climbing ladders. They're building elevators.

The question for every executive:

Are you building an organization people want to join, or one they're building around?
