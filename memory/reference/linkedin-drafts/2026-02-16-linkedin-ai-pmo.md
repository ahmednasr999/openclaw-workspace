title: AI-Enabled PMO
status: draft

Spotify just reported their best developers haven't written a line of code since December.

Not because they stopped working. Because AI agents now handle the coding.

This is what the PMO of 2025 looks like:

• Predictive forecasting (not reactive reporting)
• Autonomous workflow design (not manual task tracking)  
• AI-generated status reports (not 4-hour manual updates)

The PMO isn't getting smaller. It's becoming the AI Operations nerve center.

Three predictions I'm betting on:

1. "AI PMO" becomes a board expectation by Q3
2. Project managers become AI workflow designers (not trackers)
3. Digital transformation stalls if the PMO can't operate at machine speed

The organizations that figure this out first will capture 40-60% efficiency gains.

The ones that don't will wonder why their transformation initiatives keep missing deadlines.

Which side is your organization on?
