A solo developer just got billion-dollar bids from Meta and OpenAI.

He had zero employees and was losing $20K/month.

The OpenClaw story proves something I've been saying about AI-enabled PMOs:

A moderately capable system with unrestricted access outperforms a genius confined to silos.

Peter Steinberger ran 4-10 AI coding agents simultaneously. Made 6,600 commits in January alone.

This isn't about replacing teams. It's about multiplying what one strategic leader can accomplish.

The numbers are staggering:
• 6,600 commits in one month (one person)
• 196,000 GitHub stars in 3 months
• Billion-dollar bids, zero revenue

The CDO who understands this will build the AI Operations nerve center.

The one who doesn't will wonder why their transformation stalled.

What's your take — is the one-person unicorn the future or an outlier?
