🚀 Leading Digital Transformation in Healthcare: It's Not About Technology

After 20 years transforming organizations across HealthTech, FinTech, and e-commerce, I've learned one truth:

Digital transformation fails when we focus on tech first.

The real drivers? People. Process. Culture.

Here's what actually works:

1️⃣ Start with the problem, not the solution
2️⃣ Get executive sponsorship EARLY
3️⃣ Measure what matters (revenue, efficiency, patient outcomes)
4️⃣ Celebrate small wins to build momentum

I've seen $25M+ transformations succeed when leaders understand that technology is an ENABLER, not the answer.

What's your biggest challenge in digital transformation?
