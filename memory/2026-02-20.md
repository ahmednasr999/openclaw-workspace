- PDF preview and download
- Textarea instead of single-line input

### Task Board Fixes
- Added "Pending" column
- Fixed task filtering - tasks now show in correct columns
- Task cards enhanced with category tags, progress bars
- Task ID displayed on cards

### Agent Office Wiring
- Connected to Task Board data
- Shows real agent status from task assignments
- Working status indicators based on task assignments

### Dashboard Enhancements (Crashed → Reverted)
- Added Quick Actions buttons
- Added Quick Stats (completed, in progress, overdue)
- Added Job Search Overview
- Added Upcoming Deadlines
- Added Recent Activity
- Added Quick Links to job boards
- Caused server crashes, reverted to stable

### UI Improvements
- Task modal enhanced with gradient header
- Better input styling (black background, white text)
- Task cards have gradient category tags
- Progress bars for subtasks

### Evening Session - Mission Control Wiring

#### Tasks Created:
- Task 49: Content Pipeline → LinkedIn/X
- Task 50: CV Maker → Telegram
- Task 51: Agents → Task Board
- Task 52: Dashboard enhancements
- Task 53: Agents auto-task creation
- Task 54: Knowledge Exchange API
- Task 55: Dashboard real-time updates

#### Completed Wiring:

1. **Content Pipeline → LinkedIn/X (Task 49, 52)**
   - Added `/api/content/linkedin` endpoint
   - Added `/api/content/x` endpoint
   - When content status changes to "Published", auto-triggers posting
   - Publish button added to Content Pipeline UI
   - Shows "Sending..." while posting
   - Status auto-updates to Published after success

2. **CV Maker → Telegram (Task 50)**
   - Created `/api/cv/telegram` queue endpoint
   - CVs can be queued for Telegram delivery
   - Ready for UI integration

3. **Agents → Task Board (Task 51, 53)**
   - Created `/api/tasks/agent` endpoint
   - Created `/api/tasks/auto` endpoint
   - Auto-create tasks for specific agents
   - Ready to hook into agent spawn events

4. **Knowledge Exchange (Task 54)**
   - Created `/api/knowledge` endpoint
   - Query knowledge base: `GET /api/knowledge?q=search`
   - Add knowledge: `POST /api/knowledge`
   - Categories: company, content, interview, market, outreach
   - Already added sample knowledge (GMG company profile)

5. **Dashboard Real-time (Task 55)**
   - Added polling every 30 seconds
   - Dashboard auto-refreshes without manual refresh

### Key Learnings

1. **Always create task BEFORE starting work**
   - This is a hard rule
   - Applies to ALL work, not just coding

2. **Test changes incrementally**
   - Dashboard enhancements crashed multiple times
   - Had to revert to stable version
   - Build passes but runtime fails = check code carefully

3. **Template literals in className cause issues**
   - Complex conditional className strings break build
   - Use simple string concatenation instead

4. **GitHub Auto-Backup runs at 8:30 PM UTC daily**
   - Commits any changes automatically
   - Manual backup before important changes

### Pending Work

1. **CV Maker Telegram button** - Add to UI to trigger queue
2. **Connect actual LinkedIn/X APIs** - Currently placeholder responses
3. **Hook agent spawn → task creation** - Connect /api/tasks/auto to agent events

### Files Created/Modified

- `mission-control/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Quick stats, polling
- `mission-control/components/TaskCard.tsx` - Enhanced styling

### More Wiring Tasks Completed

#### Task 56: Agent Spawn → Task Board Hook
- Created `/api/openclaw/spawn` endpoint
- Created `/api/openclaw/sync` endpoint
- Added "Sync Agents" button to Dashboard
- When OpenClaw spawns an agent, Mission Control auto-creates a task
- Agent name auto-extracted from label (QA, NASR, etc.)
- Task created with agent as assignee

**Files created:**
- `mission-control/app/api/openclaw/spawn/route.ts`
- `mission-control/app/api/openclaw/sync/route.ts`

**Pending:**
- Configure OpenClaw to call Mission Control when spawning agents
- Or use "Sync Agents" button for manual sync

---

### Late Night Session - OpenClaw → Mission Control Hook

#### Task 57: Configure OpenClaw → Mission Control Spawn Hook
- Modified `/root/.openclaw/packages/gateway/src/gateway.ts`
- Added webhook call to Mission Control when agents spawn
- Mission Control endpoint: `POST /api/openclaw/spawn`
- Auto-creates task in Task Board with agent as assignee
- Tested and verified working

**What was built:**
1. OpenClaw gateway calls `http://localhost:3001/api/openclaw/spawn` when spawning
2. Passes `{runId, label, task, model}`
3. Mission Control extracts agent name (QA Agent, NASR, etc.)
4. Auto-creates task in Task Board

**Verified:**
- Agent spawn → Task created in Task Board
- QA Agent, NASR, etc. appear as assignees
- Tasks labeled "Auto-created from OpenClaw run"

**Files modified:**
- `packages/gateway/src/gateway.ts` - Added webhook call

**Files created:**
- `mission-control/app/api/openclaw/spawn/route.ts`
- `mission-control/app/api/openclaw/sync/route.ts`

**Status:**
- OpenClaw → Mission Control spawn hook: ✅ Working
- Agent spawn → Task Board auto-creation: ✅ Working
- Pending: Telegram button in CV Maker UI
