# CASE STUDY 3: Network International - Enterprise PMO Across 8 Countries

## The Challenge

Network International (acquired by ENPO) needed to establish a unified PMO across their payments network spanning:
- Egypt, UAE, Jordan, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Mauritius, South Africa

Key challenges:
- 300+ concurrent banking/payments projects
- No standardized methodology
- Inconsistent project delivery
- Limited visibility across regions

## The Solution

We built an enterprise PMO framework from scratch:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- PMO methodology design (hybrid Agile/Waterfall)
- Governance framework establishment
- Project management tools (MS Project Server)
- Training program for 16 Project Managers

### Phase 2: Implementation (Months 3-5)
- Rollout across 8 countries
- Standardized templates and reporting
- Risk management framework
- Portfolio dashboard development

### Phase 3: Maturity (Months 6-8)
- Advanced analytics integration
- Predictive resource allocation
- Automated compliance reporting
- Continuous improvement cycle

## Key Learnings

1. **Executive sponsorship is non-negotiable:** Without CEO buy-in, PMO fails
2. **Local adaptation matters:** Global standards need local flavor
3. **Tool adoption takes time:** Training is an ongoing investment
4. **Metrics drive behavior:** What you measure, you improve
