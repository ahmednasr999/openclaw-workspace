# CV OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOL
**Created:** 2026-02-16  
**Trigger:** Claude feedback on Director of Digital Transformation CV  
**Purpose:** Never repeat keyword optimization failure

---

## THE FAILURE (68/100 vs 88/100)

**Root Cause:** I optimized for visual presentation over ATS keyword density.

| My Approach | Result | Optimal Approach | Result |
|------------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Clean formatting | ✅ 95/100 | Keyword extraction | ✅ 95/100 |
| Brief bullets | ✅ 85/100 | Keyword density | ✅ 95/100 |
| Professional look | ✅ 90/100 | Strategic language | ✅ 92/100 |
| **Keyword matching** | ❌ 55/100 | **Deep keyword mapping** | ✅ 95/100 |

---

## THE LESSON

> **ATS optimization requires obsessive keyword matching, not just professional formatting.**

---

## CV OPTIMIZATION PROCESS (MANDATORY)

### Step 1: EXTRACT ALL KEYWORDS
Before writing ANY content, extract:
- [ ] All nouns/phrases from job description
- [ ] All "must have" requirements
- [ ] All "preferred" qualifications
- [ ] Company values/mission language
- [ ] Industry-specific terminology

### Step 2: SCORE AGAINST KEYWORDS
- Count total unique keywords/phrases: ___
- Score current CV (what % are present?): ___/100
- **TARGET: 85%+ keyword match before finalizing**

### Step 3: REWRITE EVERY BULLET
Each bullet should include 2-3 job-specific keywords.

### Step 4: FRAME THROUGH ROLE LENS
If job mentions "regulated environment," frame ALL relevant experience through that lens.

### Step 5: VERIFY BEFORE SUBMITTING
- Re-run keyword score: ___/100
- Target: 85%+
- If below 85%, rewrite more bullets.

1. Extract EVERY keyword/phrase from JD
2. Score current content against keywords
3. Rewrite EVERY bullet with 2-3 keywords
4. Frame through job's key themes
5. Verify 85%+ match before submitting

## EXAMPLE: Before & After

### Job Requirement
> "Experience in highly regulated environments, operating models, government entity engagement"
