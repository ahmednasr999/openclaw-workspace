<!-- PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY -->
<h2>Professional Summary</h2>
<p class="summary">
  Builder, operator, and growth leader with 20+ years launching and scaling technology-driven businesses across GCC and MENA markets.

Founded Egypt's first FinTech SuperApp from zero: designed the product architecture, built the team, established the partner ecosystem, and executed the market entry playbook. Currently leading a $50M digital transformation portfolio across 15 operating sites in three countries. Equally comfortable in a boardroom and a war room. Moves fast, owns outcomes, and builds things that did not exist before. Native Arabic speaker with deep MENA market intuition and an established regional network across Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Egypt.
