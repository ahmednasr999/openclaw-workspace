**Subject:** Executive PMO Leadership - National Wellness Partners

**Message:**

Hi [Name],

I noticed National Wellness Partners is leading digital transformation in the UAE healthcare sector.

I'm a Senior Technology Executive with 20+ years experience:
- **SGH (Egypt):** Led $50M transformation, reduced reporting by 97%
- **Talabat (GCC):** Scaled operations 233x in 18 months
- **Network (8 countries):** PMO for 300+ projects

I'm exploring senior leadership opportunities in HealthTech, particularly PMO, Digital Transformation, or CDO roles.

Would you have 15 minutes for a brief call this week?

Best regards,
Ahmed Nasr
Senior Technology Executive | PMO & AI Transformation
