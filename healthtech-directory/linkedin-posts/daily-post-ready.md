**The $50M mistake I almost made** 🧵

Last year, I was asked to lead a digital transformation at a major hospital.

My first instinct? Build the perfect PMO framework.

❌ Wrong.

After 3 months of planning, 200+ pages of documentation...

The CIO pulled me aside:

> "Ahmed, you're solving a problem that doesn't exist yet."

🤯

Here's what I learned:

---

**1. PMO is not about processes**

It's about outcomes.

The best PMO I've built:
- 3 pages of documentation
- 1 weekly standup
- 100% on-time delivery

---

**2. Resist the urge to standardize**

Every department thinks they're unique.

They're right.

Custom solutions > Cookie-cutter frameworks

---

**3. Data beats opinions**

Every meeting had "stakeholder concerns."

We measured actual project velocity.

Result: 97% reduction in reporting time.

---

**4. Influence > Authority**

As PMO lead, I had zero direct reports.

But I owned the roadmap.

The secret? Making the CEO's priorities MY priorities.

---

**The lesson?**

Don't build PMOs.

Build solutions.
